Github Repository for the ASU CSE 485 Capstone project "Endless Moments LLC - An Intelligent Safety-Focused Dating App"

Lyra is not ‚Äújust another dating app‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs a platform that blends community, exclusivity, and technology. 
1. Core Matching Engine
Uses AI/ML models to match users based on personality traits, shared interests, and behavioral data (not just swipes).
Incorporates blockchain verification (optional) for identity and credibility.
Dynamic scoring: ‚ÄúThe more you use it, the smarter your matches get.‚Äù

2. Profile Experience
Rich multimedia profiles (short video intros, Spotify/Apple Music integration, lifestyle snapshots).
Gamified authenticity checks (voice prompts, Q&A video clips, short games) to reduce catfishing.
AI-curated ‚ÄúHighlights‚Äù ‚Äî the app auto-summarizes your vibe for others in one glance.

Free tier with limited matches.
Premium tier with curated invites and access to exclusive communities.

Localized ‚Äúmicro-communities‚Äù (e.g., Austin entrepreneurs, Dallas creatives).

4. Safety & Trust
AI monitors for scam/harassment patterns.
Verified check (like Twitter Blue, but tied to ID verification).
In-chat safety tools (quick block/report, auto-flagging risky content).

5. Engagement & Retention
Smart icebreakers powered by AI (contextual conversation starters).
Streaks & milestones to encourage consistent engagement.
Integration with third-party APIs (Spotify, Instagram, TikTok) for richer discovery.

6. Revenue Model
Subscriptions: Premium tiers (unlimited matches, advanced filters, event access).

All Features Explained
1. Smart Matching (the brain of the app)
Instead of just swiping left or right like Tinder or Bumble, the app uses AI (artificial intelligence) to figure out what kind of people you actually click with.
It looks at your hobbies, personality, and how you act in the app.
The more you use it, the smarter it gets at recommending people you‚Äôll actually vibe with.

2. Profiles That Feel Real
Most apps are just pictures and one-liners. Ours makes profiles come alive:
You can add short intro videos (so people see your energy, not just a selfie).
Add your music or playlists (so someone who loves Drake finds you).
Do quick fun prompts (like ‚Äúrecord yourself answering: dogs or cats?‚Äù).
This makes it harder for fake people (catfish) to sneak in and makes it easier to tell who you‚Äôd actually get along with.

4. Communities and Events
We don‚Äôt just throw you into a giant dating pool. Instead:
You can join smaller groups (like ‚ÄúAustin Musicians‚Äù or ‚ÄúDallas Startups‚Äù).
The app hosts real-world events (mixers, concerts, pop-ups) so you can meet people safely offline too.
Imagine if Bumble had its own concerts or hangouts, not just dates.

5. Safety First
A lot of dating apps struggle with scams and creeps. We add layers of protection:
Verified check marks (you prove you‚Äôre real with ID, not just a selfie).
AI that can spot bad behavior (like harassment or scam attempts).
One-tap block/report buttons to keep control in your hands.
It‚Äôs like having a hall monitor built into the app, so you feel safe using it.

6. Icebreakers and Fun
Talking to strangers is hard. So we help:
AI gives you conversation starters (‚ÄúYou both love sushi ‚Äî ask what their go-to roll is!‚Äù).
Little games, challenges, or streaks to keep the vibe fun.
You can even unlock ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù that show your best traits automatically.
It‚Äôs like having a friend whisper in your ear what things to say.
